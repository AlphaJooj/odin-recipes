    <h2>A Brief Explanation and Background</h2>
    <p> Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
        flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such
        as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
        baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

    <p>Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
        Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is
        uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was
        sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.</p>
