    <h2>A Brief Explanation and Background</h2>
    <p>Pudding is a type of food that can be sweet or savoury, cooked or uncooked depending on where and when it is
        made. Pudding means dessert in most of the world and in the United Kingdom, pudding is used as a synonym for
        dessert. In North America, pudding is normally a milk-based dessert similar in consistency to egg-based
        custards, instant custards or a mousse, often set using cornstarch, gelatin or similar coagulating agent such as
        Jell-O and flavoured and sweetened. Commercial pudding mixes provide all ingredients except the milk.</p>

    <p>n the United Kingdom and some of the Commonwealth countries, pudding is used to describe sweet or savoury dishes.
        Pudding is claimed to be a British invention, and is a characteristic dish of British cuisine. Savoury
        puddings include Yorkshire pudding, black pudding, suet pudding and steak and kidney pudding. Sweet puddings
        include boiled puddings, (Christmas pudding is a good example), steamed puddings, baked puddings, bread
        puddings, batter puddings, milk puddings (rice pudding) or even jellies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the sugar and water in the pot. Heat the pot at medium heat.</li>
        <li>Let it sit until the surface becomes lightly-colored. Swirl the pot and even out the sugar liquid.</li>
        <li>Caramelize the sugar and remove the pot from the heat.</li>
        <li>Quickly add the hot water in 2 to 3 steps with a long-handled ladle. Tilt the pot away from you to avoid hot caramel sauce splashing and burning your hand. Swirl the pot and even out the hot caramel.</li>
        <li>Pour the caramel evenly into custard cups.</li>
        <li>Crack the two eggs into a bowl. Lightly beat the egg with a balloon whisk. Do not let the tip of the whisk leave the bottom of the bowl to avoid creating too much foam.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and sugar in a pot. Turn on the burner. Stir with a spatula until all the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Add the milk to the beaten egg while whisking the mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into an easy-to-pour container.</li>
        <li> Gently fill the custard cups with the egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover each cup with aluminum foil. The foil will prevent the surface from getting dry. It will also help steam the pudding evenly.</li>
        <li>Heat water in a pan and gently place the cups in it. The kitchen towel will soften the heat at the bottom. There should be enough hot water to cover the bottom half of the cups. Put the lid on.</li>
        <li>Keep the water temperature just below the boiling point and steam the pudding for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put kitchen gloves on and remove the custard cups. When they become cool, store them in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Scrape the side of the cup with the tip of a knife. Tap the cup on a kitchen towel and make a space around the pudding.</li>
        <li>Serve the pudding on a plate.</li>
    </ol>
